# pawn-development

> **Warning**: This is my first experience with TypeScript. This extension is experimental and may crash or contain bugs. I am not qualified in TypeScript and will not be offering support. Please use it at your own risk.

## Features
This extension includes the following features compared to the AmyrAhmady fork:
- **Color picking**: Supports formats 0xRRGGBBAA, 0xRRGGBB, and {RRGGBB}.
- **GameText color recognition**: Displays the color in a square. This feature is disabled in the settings by default but can be enabled at will.

## Credits
- [Indian Ocean Roleplay™ (samarmeena)](https://github.com/iorp-in/pawn-community-tool) for the original creation of this extension.
- [AmyrAhmady](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/vscode-pawn) from the open.mp team for the contributions on his fork.
